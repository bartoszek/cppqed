   * The assumption is that the time when the Schr√∂dinger picture and interaction picture (if any) coincide is `tIntPic0`. There are two important points to note:
   * -# The contribution has to be *added* to `dpsidt` instead of `dpsidt` being *replaced*. 
   * This is because when the given system is embedded in a larger system, other (sub)systems may also contribute.
   * -# The function has to calculate the effect of \f$\frac{H(t)}i\f$ and not merely \f$H\f$, since it is the former which determines the derivative of the state vector.
   * 
   * This latter is so often missed, that we emphasize it again (although we know that it will still be missed from time to time):
   * \warning When implementing the Hamiltonian, not \f$H\f$ itself but \f$\frac Hi\f$ has to supplied!
