Installation guide {#installationguide}
==================

Todo
----

* Form of distribution (less reliance on packages, more integration?)

  * Switch to new FLENS (header only) & distribute it together with the project
  * Try to turn Blitz++ also into a header-only dependence
  * Boost – distribute together with the project those parts that are needed, if it gets installed, then enable serialization
    * or, try to use Boost’s cmake to integrate its compilation
