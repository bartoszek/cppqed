<h1>C++QED</h1>
<h3>a framework for simulating open
  quantum dynamics</h3>

<h2>Synopsis</h2>

<p> C++QED is a framework for simulating open quantum dynamics in
general. Historically, it has in the first place been developed for
problems in moving-particle cavity QED, but since then has been
applied in several other fields in quantum optics. It is known to be
able to simulate full Master equation up to several thousand, and
quantum trajectories up to several hundred thousand dimensions. </p>

<p> The basic idea of the framework is to allow users to build arbitrarily
complex interacting quantum systems from elementary free subsystems
and interactions between them (these are commonly referred to as
<em>elements</em>), and simulate their time evolution with a number of
available time-evolution drivers. Operating with elementary physical
systems, the interface is of much higher level than in the popular
Quantum Optics toolbox for Matlab <a href="#matlab_ref">[1]</a>, or
the much less known, but venerable <acronym title="Quantum State Diffusion">QSD</acronym> C++ library <a href="#qsd_ref">[2]</a>, as in
the latter two the interface is built on quantum operators. </p>

<p> C++QED specifies a small grammar to describe composite quantum
systems, which qualifies as a domain specific language (in this case
embedded into C++). Apart from providing a number of elements out of
the box, there are several tools which facilitate the implementation
of new elements. These are being added continuously, <q>on demand</q>
from the quantum-optics community.</p>

<p> As of today, the following possibilities for time evolution are
provided in the framework:

<dl>

<dt>Full Master equation</dt>

<dt>Single <acronym title="Monte Carlo wave-function">MCWF</acronym>
  trajectory</dt> 
<dd> We use a modification of the original method with higher order
   adaptive stepsize time evolution.</dd>

<dt>Ensemble of quantum (at present, MCWF) trajectories</dt> 

</dl>

A number of other methods, e.g. the quantum state diffusion, can be
easily incorporated into the framework. Note that in the case when the
probability of quantum jumps vanishes, the MCWF method reduces to the
simulation of the Schroedinger equation, so that the latter is
naturally available in the framework.
</p>


<h2>Performance issues</h2>

<p>The framework is very sensitive to performance both in terms of
computer resources and coding/design. In the latter aspect the goal,
as always in software design, is to create maximally reusable code. In
the former aspect, there are physical and computational methods to
increase performance. Among the physical ones, the most notable is the
maximal use of interaction picture, which may help to get rid of very
separate timescales in the problem. Among the computational ones we
can mention

<ul>

<li>Maximal exploitation of special operator structures, i.e., sparse
  and tridiagonal matrices</li>

<li>The use of adaptive-stepsize methods for evolving ordinary
  differential equations</li>

<li>Judicious use of memory</li>

</ul>

</p>

<h2>Analysis and Visualization</h2>

<p>For fast and easy interpretation of the data produced by C++QED there exists a python
library called PyCppQED which automatizes this task as far as possible. It also provides
functions for creating convenient initial statevectors which then can be passed on to
C++QED.</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2> 

<p>The first release of the framework has been partially documented in
a journal article <a href="#cppqed_ref">[3]</a>, which still applies from the physics point of
view.</p>

<p>There is a
  new <a href="http://cppqed.sourceforge.net/_downloads/tutorial.pdf">tutorial</a>
  for the second release, and a full (reference or extenders') manual
  is in preparation.</p>

<p>For PyCppQED there exists a tutorial and a complete reference. It can be downloaded from
<a href="http://github.com/bastikr/pycppqed/downloads">github</a>.
