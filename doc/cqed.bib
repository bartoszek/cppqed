  pages =	 {4879},
abstract={A Monte Carlo simulation of the atomic master equation for
spontaneous emission in terms of atomic wave functions is
developed. Realizations of the time evolution of atomic wave functions
are constructed that correspond to an ensemble of atoms driven by
laser light undergoing a sequence of spontaneous emissions. The atomic
decay times are drawn according to the photon count distribution of
the driven atom. Each quantum jump of the atomic electron projects the
atomic wave function to the ground state of the atom. Our theory is
based on a stochastic interpretation and generalization of Mollow's
pure-state analysis of resonant light scattering, and the
Srinivas-Davies theory of continuous measurements in
photodetection. An extension of the theory to include mechanical light
effects and a generalization to atomic systems with Zeeman
substructure are given. We illustrate the method by simulating the
solutions of the optical Bloch equations for two-level systems, and
laser cooling of a two-level atom in an ion trap where the
center-of-mass motion of the atom is described quantum mechanically.}

  year = 1993,
  volume = 10,
  pages = {524},
abstract = {We present a wave-function approach to the study of the
evolution of a small system when it is coupled to a large
reservoir. Fluctuations and dissipation originate in this approach
from quantum jumps that occur randomly during the time evolution of
the system. This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation
operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the
standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states
N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can
be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the
master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N
components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms. We
evaluate the gain in computing time that may be expected from such a
formalism, and we discuss its applicability to several examples, with
particular emphasis on a quantum description of laser cooling.}

  abstract={We study quantum particles at zero temperature in an optical lattice coupled to a resonant cavity mode. The cavity field substantially modifies the particle dynamics in the lattice, and for strong particle-field coupling leads to self-organization of the particles, a configuration with only every second site occupied. We study the growth of this order out of a homogeneous initial distribution for few particles. Simulations reveal that the growth dynamics crucially depends on the initial quantum many-body state of the particles and can be monitored via the cavity fluorescence. Studying the relaxation time of the ordering reveals inhibited tunnelling due to the interaction with the cavity field. However, the relaxation becomes very quick for strong coupling.}
