C++QED: a framework for simulating open quantum dynamics {#mainpage}
========================================================

\tableofcontents

C++QED is a highly flexible framework for simulating open quantum dynamics.
It allows users to build arbitrarily complex interacting quantum systems from
elementary free subsystems and interactions, and simulate their time evolution
with a number of available time-evolution drivers.
