C++QED is a C++/Python framework for simulating open quantum dynamics. It allows users to build arbitrarily complex interacting quantum systems from elementary free subsystems and interactions, and simulate their time evolution with a number of available time-evolution drivers.

Earlier, C++QED was located at sourceforge: http://cppqed.sf.net
