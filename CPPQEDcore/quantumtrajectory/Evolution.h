Synopsis
--------

C++QED is a framework for simulating open quantum dynamics in general. Originally it was developed for problems in moving-particle cavity quantum electrodynamics, but subsequently has been applied in other fields as well. It has demonstrated the ability to simulate full Master equation of up to several thousand, and quantum trajectories of up to several hundred thousand dimensions.

The basic idea is to allow users to build arbitrarily complex interacting quantum systems from elementary free subsystems and interactions (below these are commonly referred to as |element| s), and simulate their time evolution with a number of available time-evolution drivers. Operating with elementary physical systems, the interface is of a much higher level than that in the popular Quantum Optics Toolbox for Matlab \cite tan99, or the much less known, but venerable QSD (Quantum State Diffusion) C++ library \cite schack97. In both, the interface is built on quantum operators, and general usage involves a considerable amount of boilerplate.

C++QEDv2 specifies a small grammar to describe composite quantum systems. Apart from providing a number of elements out of the box, there are several tools which facilitate the implementation of new elements. These are being added continuously, as the need arises.

The framework saw a first release (v1), which was also partially documented in a journal article [EPJD]\_. As to physics, this paper still applies, and the reader should consult it if something is not clear from the physics point of view in the following. The differences between C++QEDv1 and v2 are so numerous that it is easier to describe the similarities, which essentially lie in the basic idea of the interface as described above. Because of this, and despite all the differences, experience has shown that it is not difficult migrate elements and |script| s written for v1 to v2. C++QEDv1 relied on a pure object-oriented design, while in v2 the emphasis is more on generic programming and template metaprogramming. In particular, the principal concept of the design of C++QEDv2 is that *all information available at compile time should be processed as such*, with the help of template metaprogramming. All in all, v1 can be regarded as a prototype of v2.

At the moment the following possibilities for time evolution are provided in the framework (cf. :ref:\`quantumtrajectory\`):

:class:\`Full <quantumtrajectory::Master\>\` Master equation.
  Simple adaptive-stepsize evolution.

:class:\`Single <quantumtrajectory::MCWF\_Trajectory\>\` Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory.
  We use a modification of the original method with higher order adaptive-stepsize time evolution.

:class:\`Ensemble <quantumtrajectory::EnsembleMCWF\>\` of quantum (at present, Monte Carlo wave-function) trajectories.
  These are evolved serially at the moment, parallelization should be implemented here.

A number of other methods, e.g. the quantum state diffusion, can be easily incorporated into the framework.

### Performance issues

The framework is very sensitive to performance both in terms of computer resources and coding/design. In the latter aspect the goal, as always in software architecture, is to create maximally reusable code. Perhaps the most spectacular example is that the very same code, if it is written generally enough, can be used to calculate Monte Carlo wave-function and full Master-equation evolution.

In the former aspect, there are physical and computational methods to increase performance. Among the physical ones, the most notable is the maximal use of interaction picture, which may help to get rid of very separate timescales in the problem. Among the computational ones we can mention

-   Maximal exploitation of special operator structures, i.e., sparse and tridiagonal matrices.

-   The use of adaptive-stepsize methods for evolving ordinary differential equations.

-   Judicious use of memory. The guideline is: If it is necessary to copy something, ask first whether it is *really* necessary.

In addition, we have to note that simulation of moving particles is inherently hard, since the Schr√∂dinger equation is a partial differential equation, and we inevitably have to deal with both position and momentum representations, which are linked by Fourier transformation. In our problems, however, the particles are mostly moving in potentials created by electromagnetic fields, mainly standing and running waves. In this case we can stay in momentum space during the whole time evolution, and no |FFT| is necessary (cf. [EPJD]\_ and :ref:\`generalElements\_Particle\`).

A strange consequence is that in numerical physics the harmonic oscillator seems to be hard, while the cosine potential is easy.

Installation
------------

### Quick start: Installation from binary packages (Ubuntu)

Binary packages have been prepared for [Ubuntu](http://www.launchpad.net/~raimar-sandner/cppqed) which might also work on Debian (not tested). Installation from binary packages is recommended for users who want to try C++QED or use it exclusively on its highest level, i.e. writing scripts which use elements and interactions already implemented in C++QED. If you are not using Ubuntu or want to develop your own elements and interactions you have to install C++QED :ref:\`from source <installFromSource\>\`.

To install the binary packages

    % sudo add-apt-repository ppa:raimar-sandner/cppqed
    % sudo apt-get update
    % sudo apt-get install libc++qed-dev c++qed-scripts

This will install all necessary dependencies and the following three packages:

-   **c++qed-scripts**: The precompiled and ready to run scripts distributed with C++QED. For example, call `1particle1mode` to see how C++QED output looks like.

-   **libc++qed-<version\>**: This is the runtime library which all scripts are linked against.

-   **libc++qed-<version\>-dev**: The header file needed to compile new scripts. This package also contains an example project which demonstrates how to compile scripts.

If you want to start developing your own scripts, copy the example project directory `/usr/share/doc/libc++qed-<version>-dev/examples` to some place convenient and refer to the file `Readme.txt` in this directory for instructions.

### Installation from source

Writing and executing scripts
-----------------------------

In the following we will cover how to use the framework on the highest level. The highest level is a C++ program, which is called a |script|. A Python frontend is currently under development, and a :abbr:\`GUI (Graphical User Interface)\` might eventually be provided, too.

A script creates an executable which defines and simulates a system of a particular layout. All information pertaining to the layout of the system is processed at compile time. Our compile-time algorithms can be regarded as C++ programs generating C++ programs in such a way that in the resulting executable all the compile-time information is encoded to yield a maximally efficient executable for the given layout.

A script is composed of a part where the system is specified, and another, where we do something with the system, most notably simulate its time evolution in one of the ways described in the :ref:\`sec\_Synopsis\`.

### An elementary example

The simplest case is when we want to simulate a free system alone. Assume that this free system is a mode of a cavity (cf. :ref:\`generalElements\_Mode\`), which can be pumped and is lossy. We begin with defining the system, which is trivial in this case:

    PumpedLossyMode mode(delta,kappa,eta,cutoff);

Once we have defined a system, we can already use it for several things, e.g. to calculate the action of the system Hamiltonian on a given state vector, but since C++QED is a "framework for simulating open quantum dynamics", we will probably want to do something more.

Suppose we want to run a single Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory. The system is started from a pure initial state, which may be specified as

    quantumdata::StateVector<1> psi(mode::coherent(alpha,cutoff));

that is, the mode is in a coherent state with amplitude `alpha` (cf. :func:\`mode::coherent\`). quantumdata::StateVector`<1>` means that it is a state vector of a system featuring a single quantum number.

Next, we define our quantumtrajectory::MCWF_Trajectory `<1>`:

    quantumtrajectory::MCWF_Trajectory<1> trajectory(psi,mode,...a lot more parameters...);

The first two parameters are clear, the only thing to note is that `psi` is taken as a reference here, so the initial `psi` will be actually evolved as we evolve the trajectory. A lot more parameters are needed, pertaining to the ordinary differential equation stepper, the random number generation, etc., but, as we will see :ref:\`below <userGuideParameters\>\`, the user will usually not have to worry about these.

All that remains is to run the trajectory, which is accomplished by

    runDt(trajectory,time,dt);

This will evolve `trajectory` for time `time`, and display information about the state of the system after every time interval `dt`. What information is displayed is defined by the system. There is another version, which can be invoked like this:

    run(trajectory,time,dc);

Here, `dc` is expected to be an integer, and it is the number of (adaptive) timesteps between two displays. This version is actually more suited to the physics of the problem, since the timesteps will be small, when many things are happening, and this is when we want more output, too.

\see trajectory::run

#### Parameters

In the above, the necessary parameters must be previously defined somewhere. Parameters can of course come from several sources, but the most useful alternative is to have sensible defaults for all parameters, and to be able to override each of them separately in the command line when the program is actually executed with a given set of parameters. This allows for a very fine-grained control over what is to be accepted as default and what is to be overridden, and the command line never gets crowded by those parameters for which the default is fine.

This possibility is indeed supported by the framework, cf. :ref:\`cpputils\_Parameters\`. Consider the following program [^1]:

This is a full-fledged |script|, so if you copy this into directory :[file:](file:)\`scripts\` under the name of :[file:](file:)\`temp.cc\`, it will compile. Don't forget to re-run `cmake` in order to pick up the new script and call

    make temp

in the build directory. Alternatively, if you use `bjam`, compile the script with

    bjam [release] temp 

Let us analyse the script line by line:

-   :class:\`\~parameters::ParameterTable\` is the module from our utility library :ref:\`utils <utilsDefinition\>\` which stores all the parameters of the problem, and enables them to be manipulated from the command line. It can store any type for which i/o operations are defined.

-   We instantiate the actual parameters for the time-evolution driver(s) and the mode, respectively. All the modules in the framework provide corresponding :class:\`Pars...\` classes.

-   We specify the desired default values, e.g. we set that the default evolution mode should be Master equation [^2].

-   The command line is parsed by the :func:\`\~parameters::update\` function. Parsing is not very sophisticated at the moment, but some errors do get detected at this point.

-   In the next line, we instantiate our mode, but now instead of the concrete :class:\`PumpedLossyMode\` class, we are using a :func:\`make <\~mode::make\>\` (or dispatcher) function, which selects the best mode class corresponding to the parameters. There are 10 possibilities:

    Roughly speaking, :type:\`mode::Ptr\` is an entity that can store either of these classes. E.g. if `kappa=0`, and `eta=0`, then we will have a :class:\`Mode\`; if `eta` is nonzero, a :class:\`PumpedMode\`; and if both are nonzero, a :class:\`PumpedLossyMode\`. The significance of this is that e.g. if the mode is not lossy, then the possibility of a quantum jump will not even be considered during time evolution, which speeds things up.

    `Sch`, `UIP` and no suffix mean Schr√∂dinger picture, unitary interaction picture, and "full" interaction picture, respectively. It is easy to see that if the system is not lossy, then the latter two coincide. Schr√∂dinger picture is provided mostly for testing purposes, the performance is usually not optimal in this case.

    What we are telling the maker function in the same line is that the picture should be unitary interaction picture. Alternatively, we could add this as a parameter as well, which can be achieved by putting the line

        QM_Picture& qmp=p.add("picture","Quantum mechanical picture",QMP_UIP);

    anywhere between `ParameterTable` and `update`.

-   In the next line, :class:\`mode::StateVector\` is just another name for :class:\`quantumdata::StateVector\` `<1>`, and :func:\`\~mode::init\` is just another dispatcher, this time for the initial condition of the mode.

-   Finally, in the last line :func:\`evolve\` is a dispatcher for different evolution modes and the two versions :func:\`\~trajectory::run\` and :func:\`\~trajectory::runDt\`. So with this, the evolution mode can be changed from the command line, e.g. depending on the dimension of the problem ‚Äì while for low dimension we may use Master equation, for larger dimension we may need to switch to an ensemble of quantum trajectories. The possibilities are:

    `--evol master`
      ~ :class:\`Full <quantumtrajectory::Master\>\` Master equation

    `--evol single`
      ~ :class:\`Single <quantumtrajectory::MCWF\_Trajectory\>\` Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory

    `--evol ensemble`
      ~ :class:\`Ensemble <quantumtrajectory::EnsembleMCWF\>\` of Monte Carlo wave-function trajectories

If we specify the `--help` option in the command line, the program will display all the available parameters together with their types (the less readable the more complex the type is), a short description, and the default value.

An example command line then looks like:

    CppQedScript --eps 1e-12 --dc 100 --deltaC -10 --cutoff 20 --eta "(2,-1)" ...

There are some parameters that are "stronger" than others. E.g. if `--dc` is nonzero, then always the :func:\`\~trajectory::run\` version will be selected by the :func:\`evolve\` function above, regardless of the value of `--Dt`. The latter will only be considered if `--dc` is zero because in this case the :func:\`\~trajectory::runDt\` version will be selected. There is a similar relationship between `--minitFock` and `--minit`: the former will always override the latter.

### Example: a binary system

Imagine we would like to define a more complex system, where a two-level atom (qbit) interacts with a single cavity mode with a Jaynes-Cummings type interaction. Both the qbit and the mode may be pumped, and they may also be lossy. First, we have to define the free |element| s of the system:

    PumpedLossyQbit qbit(deltaA,gamma,etaA);
    PumpedLossyMode mode(deltaC,kappa,etaC,cutoff);

or

    qbit::ParsPumpedLossy pq(p);
    mode::ParsPumpedLossy pm(p);
    // ... update and whatever here
    qbit::Ptr qbit(make(pq,QMP_IP));
    mode::Ptr mode(make(pm,QMP_IP));

Here :func:\`qbit::make\` will dispatch exactly the same possibilities that we have seen for the mode above.

Next, we define the interaction between them:

    JaynesCummings<> act(qbit,mode,g);

or

    jaynescummings::Pars pjc(p);
    // ... followed by
    JaynesCummings<> act(qbit,mode,pjc);

Now we have to bind together the two free subsystems with the interaction, which is simply accomplished by:

    binary::Ptr system(binary::make(act));

In the case of a :class:\`BinarySystem\` the complete layout of the system can be figured out from the single interaction element ‚Äì and this is trivial. Similarly to :type:\`mode::Ptr\`, :type:\`binary::Ptr\` is an entity which can store all the versions of :class:\`BinarySystem\` (for example, conservative or lossy).

:class:\`BinarySystem\` is an extremely powerful module, whose design reflects the basic idea behind the framework. It internally handles all the :ref:\`loops and slicing <basiSlicing\>\` that are necessary to calculate e.g. the effect of the Hamiltonian of the qbit component if it is part of a binary system. It acts and feels like any other system, like e.g., :class:\`Qbit\` itself, the difference being that the latter has only one quantum number, while :class:\`BinarySystem\` has two. A basic design principle of the framework is that it is fully recursive, that is, any composite system can act as an element of an even more complex system. [^3]

Our next task is to define the initial condition:

    StateVector<2> psi(qbit::state0()*mode::coherent(alpha,cutoff));

This is to say that the qbit is in its 0 state, and the mode is in a coherent state with amplitude `alpha`. Both states are of type :class:\`\~quantumdata::StateVector\` `<1>`, meaning that they are state vectors featuring a single quantum number, and `*` means direct product of state vectors, so the result here is a :class:\`\~quantumdata::StateVector\` `<2>`. Direct product is *not commutative* in this case, and we have to comply with the order defined above for the free systems. Alternatively, we could have said

    StateVector<2> psi(init(pq)*init(pm));

From this point on, usage is the same as we have seen above for the mode example. Since in this case the system is a :class:\`BinarySystem\`, it will reach into its constituents for the informations to display, supplying either with the corresponding reduced density operator (cf. :class:\`\~quantumdata::LazyDensityOperator\` and :ref:\`its slicing <ldoSlicing\>\`), which contains all information on the state of the subsystem.

If the system is not to be used for anything else, just for being :func:\`evolve <evolve\>\` d, we can avoid having to invent all these redundant names like `qbit`, `mode`, `act`, `system`, `trajectory`, and create everything in place. In this case a full-fledged script can be as terse as:

### Input/Output of scripts

Each trajectory output has a header part, summarizing the parameters of the given simulation. The header displays system characteristics, and lists the decay channels of the system, each decay channel endowed with an ordinal number. This list facilitates the interpretation of log output.

Following the header part, the time-dependent simulated data is displayed, organized into columns. The first two columns are time and timestep, respectively, and then, separated by tab characters, the data stemming from the different subsystems follows. A key to the data (a short description of each column) is provided at the end of the header part.

In the case of a single Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory, there is the option `--logLevel`, which, when nonzero, makes that the stepper will record certain data during the execution:

logLevel<=1
  ~ No log output *during* the trajectory.

logLevel\>0
  ~ At the trajectory's end, a summary and a list of the jump time instants and jump kinds (ordinal number of the jump which occured) ‚Äì this list is usually considered the actual quantum trajectory.

logLevel\>1
  ~ Reporting jumps also during the trajectory evolution.

logLevel\>2
  ~ Reporting `dpLimit` overshoots and the resulting stepsize decrease also during trajectory evolution.

logLevel\>3
  ~ Reporting the number of failed ordinary differential equation steps in the given step of the trajectory evolution.

The output of real numbers has a precision of three digits by default, this can be overridden by the `--precision` option. This characteristic propagates throughout the framework from trajectory headers to state-vector outputs as follows:

> -   Trajectory header: real-number parameters of overall precision, but at least 6
>
> -   Time and timestep: of overall precision, but at least 6
>
> -   Quantum averages: of overall precision
>
> -   State-vector display *within trajectories*: of `--svdPrecision` whose default value 0 signifies falling back to the overall precision
>
> -   In `.sv` file:
>
>     -   state-vector of overall precision
>
>     -   time and timestep: of overall precision, but at least 6
>
#### Output into file

The output can be piped into a file, or an output file specified with the `--o` option. For a single Monte Carlo wave-function trajectory, in the latter case where the simulation comes to an end, the final state vector and the final state of the random-number generator will be stored in a corresponding file with extension `.sv`. This allows the framework to resume a trajectory, or the resulting state-vector can be reused as an initial condition for other trajectories.

#### MCWF-trajectory continuation

If the file specified by the `--o` option already exist then the framework assumes that the trajectory has to be resumed from the final instant stored in the file. In this case a corresponding `.sv` file must also exist, which will be considered the state vector and the random-number-generator state at the final instant.

Note that a reasonable precision of the final-state output is crucial for correct continuation (cf. also [this tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&aid=3526950&group_id=187775&atid=922653))

#### MCWF-trajectory initial condition

A custom initial condition can be provided in a file whose name is passed to the framework by the `--initFile` option. If this option is given, it will override any other initial condition specified in the |script|.

#### MCWF-trajectory binary output

If the framework has been compiled with :ref:\`Boost.Serialization <boostSerialization\>\` dependence, it is possible to choose binary output for the final-state output (with extension `.svbin` in this case). This can be toggled with the `--binarySVFile` switch. This pertains also to trajectory continuation and initial-condition processing.

### More complex examples

If there are more than two free subsystems, the system can be much more complex. The number of possible interactions rises combinatorically with the number of frees. This is the situation when the full potential of C++QED is displayed.

For the description of the |element| s appearing in the following examples cf. Ref. [EPJD]\_.

#### Ring cavity

Assume we want to define a system where a particle is moving along the axis of a ring cavity, and is interacting with two counterpropagating running-wave modes of the cavity. Both of the modes are lossy, and one of them is pumped; the particle is not pumped. This system consists of three subsystems, a particle, and the two modes. There are three interactions:

(1-2)
  ~ The particle can absorb from either of the modes and emit it in a stimulated way into the *same* mode. This yields dipole force for the particle and a corresponding light shift for the mode. It is implemented by the interaction element :class:\`ParticleAlongCavity\`.

(3)
  ~ The particle can emit into the *other* mode. This yields a ternary interaction between all the frees, implemented by :class:\`ParticleTwoModes\`.

We can lay out the system as the following simple network:

![image](figures/netRing.png)
The :class:\`Composite\` module of the framework is designed to represent such a network. Assume the following definitions are in effect:

    // Instantiate Frees
    Particle        part (...);
    LossyMode       plus (...);
    PumpedLossyMode minus(...);
    // Instantiate Interactions
    ParticleAlongCavity actP(plus ,part,...,MFT_PLUS );
    ParticleAlongCavity actM(minus,part,...,MFT_MINUS);
    ParticleTwoModes    act3(plus,minus,part,...);

Here `MFT_` means the type of the mode function and can be `PLUS`, `MINUS`, `COS`, and `SIN` [EPJD]\_.

Then the system can be created by invoking the :func:\`maker function <composite::make\>\` for :class:\`Composite\` with a helper class called :class:\`Act\`:

    composite::make(
                    Act<1,0>  (actP),
                    Act<2,0>  (actM),
                    Act<1,2,0>(act3)
                    );

What we are expressing here e.g. with the specification `Act<1,2,0>(act3)` is that the 0th "leg" of the interaction element :class:\`ParticleTwoModes\`, which is the mode `plus`, is the 1st in our row of frees in the network above.

The 1st leg, the mode `minus` is the 2nd in the row; and the 2nd leg, the particle is the 0th in the row of frees. The legs of interaction elements cannot be interchanged, and we also have to be consistent with our preconceived order of frees throughout. Clearly, the three :class:\`Act\` objects above contain all the information needed by the framework to figure out the full layout of the system.

Any inconsistency in the layout will result in a compile-time or runtime error. The user is encouraged to play around creating layout errors deliberately, and see what effect they have. Creating deliberate compilation errors as a response to misuse on a higher level, in such a way that the compiler is in addition *forced* to emit a sensible error message, is difficult. However, it is of course indispensable in template metaprogramming, if we want to leave any chance for ourselves to debug our metaprograms if something goes wrong. Here we are again relying on the Boost.MPL library.

The actual C++ type of a :class:\`Composite\` object returned by such an invocation of :func:\`composite::make\` is quite complex, but a maker metafunction facilitates referencing it

    composite::result_of::Make<Act<1,0>,Act<2,0>,Act<1,2,0> >::type

which is equivalent to:

    Composite<composite::result_of::make_list<Act<1,0>,Act<2,0>,Act<1,2,0> >::type>

A full-fledged script in the terse way may read as:

A notable additional feature as compared to previous examples is that since now we have two modes in the system, we somehow have to differentiate between their parameters in the command line. This is achieved by the `"P"` and `"M"` modifiers added to the constructors of :class:\`Pars...\` objects, so that e.g. instead of `--cutoff` we now have the separate options `--cutoffP` and `--cutoffM`.

Although now all the frees have the general types contained by the :type:\`mode::Ptr\` classes, their possible types are still restricted by the :class:\`Pars...\` classes, such that e.g. `plus` can never become pumped.

Most of the interactions in C++QED will be binary, here we have seen an example for a ternary interaction. So far, we have encountered only a single example for a quaternary interaction.

#### Self-organisation example

Finally, we are reviewing one more example, which displays a last feature, which, in turn, reflects a basic principle of quantum physics: if two systems are identical, they are indistinguishable. In the language of C++QED this means that a single object is enough to represent them.

Consider two identical pumped particles moving in a direction orthogonal to the axis of a cavity sustaining a single lossy mode. The layout of the system is:

Without much ado we are quoting the kernel of a corresponding script:

    LossyMode      mode(pm); // Free0
    PumpedParticle part(pp); // Free1,2 - only one instant

    ParticleOrthogonalToCavity act(mode,part,ppc); // only one instant

    quantumdata::StateVector<3> psi(init(pm)*coherent(pp)*coherent(pp));

    evolve(psi,
           composite::make(
                           Act<0,1>(act),Act<0,2>(act),
                           Act<1,2>(IdenticalParticles<2>(part,...))
                           ),
           pe);

(A pumped particle can also be in a coherent state: a coherent state of the pump potential approximated as harmonic.)

### Assessing entanglement

In a composite system we may want to assess the entanglement between two parts of the system. This can be done using the negativity of the density operator's partial transpose. Of course, since the dependence of this quantity on the density operator is not linear, this makes sense only in the case of Master-equation evolution or an ensemble of quantum trajectories. In the case we wish to assess the entanglement for a single trajectory, this can be achieved by choosing ensemble evolution and setting the number of trajectories to 1.

The subsystem to be considered as one party of the two has to be specified in an additional compile-time vector argument to the :func:\`evolve\` function.

To show the syntax we assume e.g. that in the previous example we are looking for the entanglement between the two particles together as one party, and the mode as the other party. Then the invocation of :func:\`evolve\` is modified as

    evolve<tmptools::Vector<1,2> >(psi,system,pe);

We simply have to list in the compile-time vector :class:\`tmptools::Vector\` the frees that consist one party. Of course in this case this is equivalent to :class:\`tmptools::Vector\` `<0>`.

The negativity will appear as a last column in the output, separated by a tab character from the rest.

PyCppQED
--------

For fast and easy interpretation, analysis and visualization of the data produced by C++QED there exists a Python library called PyCppQED. It also provides functions for creating convenient initial state vectors to be passed on to C++QED. With the help of this library, it is easy to write Python scripts for automated data processing.

Release
-------

The current release of the framework is C++QEDv2 Milestone 9, and it is a release corresponding to a new significant step in the documentation and to a paper in Computer Physics Communications [CPC]\_. The development is now in beta stage with no known major bugs. The foreseeable steps in the development are as follows:

Milestone 10
  ~ will see the creation of a more general quantum-operator class of which :class:\`\~quantumoperator::Tridiagonal\` will be only one implementation, while others can be operators with sparse and full matrices. They should be arbitrarily combinable with expression-template like closures taking care of the necessary internal loops. The expression-template mechanism will be implemented using the [Boost.Proto library](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_46_1/doc/html/proto.html).

Milestone 11
  ~ will see the possibility to use non-orthogonal bases for free |element| s implemented. The framework is already prepared for this, and it is already present in prototype. A prominent example is of course modes in coherent-state bases.

Milestone ‚Ä¶
  ~ will achieve complete recursiveness in the definition of composite systems.

Milestone ‚Ä¶
  ~ possibility of partial differential equations as Schr√∂dinger equations.

PyCppQED is developed on [github](http://github.com/bastikr/pycppqed) but releases will also be posted on the SourceForge project homepage of C++QED.

Note on support
---------------

We offer full support for the framework both in terms of writing and testing new |element| s and |script| s on demand from the quantum optics community, and of advising with the use of the existing software in the framework or with the development of new software (elements, scripts, time-evolution drivers). In the first case we may require to become co-author in the publications stemming from the work. In the second case we will probably only ask to please cite the journal articles on C++QED ([EPJD]\_, [CPC]\_). We ask the same from anybody using C++QED without my support.

Acknowledgement
---------------

First of all, we would like to acknowledge the developers of Boost for making C++ an even more powerful language than it originally was. Without the Boost libraries, the framework could not have been achieved by a single person.

We would like to thank the developers of GSL, LAPACK, Blitz++, and FLENS for their effort, without which scientific computing in C++ in general, and the present framework in particular would not look as nice as it looks today.

[^2]: Ultimate defaults are anyway given by the framework at the points where the :class:\`Pars...\` class is defined, but since at those points there is no knowledge about the details of the problem, these cannot always qualify as ‚Äúsensible‚Äù.

[^3]: This can be useful e.g. in the case of a complex atom, which has internal structure and motional degrees of freedom. These two are defined as separate elements, and we can use a :class:\`BinarySystem\` to actually represent an atom with inner and outer degrees of freedom.
